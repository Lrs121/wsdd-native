    This package will install WS-Discovery Host for macOS.
    </p>
    <p>
    It allows your macOS machine to be discovered by Windows 10 and above
    systems and displayed by their Explorer "Network" views. 
    </p>
    <p>You will be guided through the steps necessary to install this software.</p>
    
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        With Windows 10 version 1511, support for SMBv1 and thus NetBIOS device discovery 
        was disabled by default. Depending on the actual edition, later versions of Windows 
        starting from version 1709 ("Fall Creators Update") do not allow the installation of 
        the SMBv1 client anymore. This causes macOS hosts not to be listed in the 
        Explorer's "Network (Neighborhood)" views.
